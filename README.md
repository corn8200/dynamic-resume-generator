# Dynamic Resume Generator

This is a simple web application built with Python and Flask that serves a dynamic, modern HTML resume.

## Why I Built This

I'm a big believer that a good TPM should stay close to the code. I built this small Flask app for a few reasons:

1.  **To Keep My Skills Sharp:** It's a fun, practical way to stay current with Python, web servers, and modern front-end practices.
2.  **To Treat My Resume Like a Product:** Using Git for version control means I can track changes, experiment with formats, and always have a single source of truth.
3.  **To Solve a Personal Problem:** I wanted a resume that looked great on screen and printed perfectly to a one-page PDF every single time, without fighting with Word templates. This app does exactly that.

Ultimately, this project is a small reflection of how I like to work: find a problem, and build a clean, simple solution for it.
